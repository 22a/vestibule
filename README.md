# Vestibule

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Outgoing mail is trapped because spam filters suck and getting email through them is something I don't want to devote time to right now, visit [`/dev/mailer`](http://localhost:4000/dev/mailer)

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
